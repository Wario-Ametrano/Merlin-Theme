#### Requirements:

- **Falkon Browser**

## Installation:
This theme can be installed in several ways.

Paste the Merlin directory to one of the following paths:
- in **$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/falkon/themes** (RECOMMENDED), for local usage, usually $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is $HOME/.config or ~/.config
- in **/usr/share/falkon/themes** (require root privileges), for system-wide installation

### Local installation (step by step):

For local installation, if the directory does not exists, you can create it using the following command:
```
mkdir -p "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME"/falkon/themes
```
if your distro does not set $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, you can use one of the following commands:
```
mkdir -p "$HOME"/.config/falkon/themes
```
or
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/falkon/themes
```

Now you can put the Merlin directory of this repository to that path. See the example below:
